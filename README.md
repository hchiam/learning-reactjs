# Learning React.js

Create components in JavaScript using React.js.

Just one of the things I'm learning. https://github.com/hchiam/learning

(Update: you can [create a React web app by running one command](https://github.com/hchiam/create-react-app).)

Shortest React example:

`
ReactDOM.render(
    <h1>Hello, world!</h1>,
    document.getElementById('root')
);
`

Facebook provides a direct link to its React JS file (and its React object and its methods) that you can embed in your HTML file:

    <script src="http://fb.me/react-0.10.0.min.js"></script>

Then you can call `React.createClass()` with an object of options and methods. 

It's recommended (but not required) to use the JSX dialect of JS (JavaScript) to write React web apps.

If you do use JSX, then:  JSX --(compile)--> JS (for browser to interpret)
